# Tweet_Quotes

This web app is created using HTML, CSS and JS.

I have used API to generate random quotes every time you click on " New Quote " button or when you refresh the page.

Make sure that you are logged in to twitter then click on tweet button => Twitter will open automatically and you can tweet that randomly generated quote without typing.
